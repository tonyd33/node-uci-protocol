# node-uci-protocol

A small library implementing the [UCI protocol](https://github.com/tonyd33/node-uci-protocol/blob/master/engine-interface.txt).
Only supports running as a server currently. For client implementations in node, see [node-uci](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-uci).

Originally made to implement an adapter for an engine written for the [Gleam Chess Tournament](https://github.com/isaacharrisholt/gleam-chess-tournament).

Yes, this is technically deno, not node. Fight me.
